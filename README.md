Professional  Porfolio

<p> my design  is far off from the homeworks model,but i wanted to create a simple an affective page that shows off what i have learned 
so far in the class and i think i have achieved it threw many tries. 
   
   
   
***challenges I faced**

   1. wanted to make a easier portfolio page that is simple and affective 
   2. spent many hours on trail and error switching out many different layouts
   3. could not get the :hover code to work on the full box after many tries 
   4. switched to only the icon items having an affect with hyper links inside
   5. again page layout was a problem for me if u refer to my early code 
   6. when making the page responsive on many different very small screen size deletes information in boxes(don't know how to fix after many attemps)
